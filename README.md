# Pro Analytics 01: Setup and Workflow Guide

This repository provides a clear, concise guide to help set up a machine for Python projects,
initialize a new Python project, and follow a repeatable project workflow
when developing professional Python projects.

The instructions are divided into three parts.

## Part 1: Set Up Machine & Sign up for GitHub

Go to [🟢 Machine Setup](01-machine-setup/MACHINE-SETUP.md) to prepare for Python projects.
Start here to set up a machine for the first time (or to upgrade or verify professional tools).

This section contains **one-time tasks** including:

1. View file extensions and hidden files and folders.
2. Optional: Install (or verify) a package manager for your operating system.
3. Install Python, Git, and Visual Studio (VS) Code for your operating system.
4. Configure Git
5. Install common VS Code extensions.
6. Create a folder on your machine to hold your GitHub projects.
7. Create a GitHub account (join 100 Million Developers!)

## Part 2: Initialize a Project

Go to [🟠 Project Initialization](02-project-initialization/PROJECT-INITIALIZATION.md) when **starting a new project**.

This section walks you through the steps to either:

1. Copy an existing project OR start a new project from scratch.
2. Clone your new GitHub repo to your machine.
3. Add common project files.
4. Git add-commit-push the changes to GitHub.
5. Create a local project virtual environment for Python.

NEW: Choose your approach for managing your virtual environment. This guide supports:

- **Option A:** traditional `venv` + `requirements.txt` - this is the **recommended** choice as it is widely used and supported across all tooling. Most course instructions refer to `venv`, and everyone working with Python should be familiar with this workflow. 

- **Option B:** a newer, faster `uv` + `pyproject.toml` - `uv` is significantly faster, but not yet widely adopted. The `pyproject.toml` file replaces `requirements.txt` and includes additional information. This is an advanced option, intended for use only after mastering Option A.

---

## Part 3: Work on the Project Over Time

Go to [🔵 Repeatable Workflow](03-repeatable-workflow/REPEATABLE-WORKFLOW.md) for ongoing project development.

This section provides the **repeatable steps** for working on Python projects.
These steps are typically followed whenever we make changes to a project. The workflow includes:

1. Pull any recent changes from GitHub.
2. Activate your virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies.
4. Run scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks.
5. Make updates, verify the code still runs, and git add-commit-push to GitHub.

---

## Important

- Follow the instructions carefully.
- Follow the instructions in the recommended order.
- Verify each step before proceeding.

## Celebrate

Follow each step carefully.
We have helped hundreds of new analysts get started with professional Python.
Verify you can run both a script and a notebook successfully.
Then, celebrate - that's a big iceberg needed to get started with Professional Python.

## Follow The Proven Path Provided

Hopefully, each step is not too bad and things go well.
When they don't - that's to be expected.
Part of the reason we get hired is to "figure things out" and we are here to help you do that.
Learn to do a web search, and experiment with free AI assistants to help explain and provide any additional details needed.
Remember, YOU are in charge.
This is the process we support and these instructions work.
Do NOT deviate unless you agree to invest time and energy to ensure any of the many alternate paths work for you throughout the program.

## Explore

AFTER that is where the power and joy of working with Python begins.
Keep good notes.
Save the working versions and then, change things. For example:

- Rename a variable.
- Add a new statement.
- Comment things out.
- Rename a function.
- View the logs. Log something new (e.g., every function when called and before returning a value).

Working with code is a fun, safe, rewarding way to learn.
If you enjoy puzzles, getting value from Python is a great way to earn a living.

## CheatSheet: Commands to Manage Virtual Environment

These commands:

1. Create a local project virtual environment in a folder named `.venv`.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install and upgrade key tools in .venv.
4. Install and upgrade required project dependencies.

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows PowerShell (recommended Option A + requirements.txt)</strong></summary>

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows PowerShell (advanced Option B + pyproject.toml)</strong></summary>

```powershell
uv venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
uv sync
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mac/Linux/WSL (recommended Option A + requirements.txt)</strong></summary>

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mac/Linux/WSL (advanced Option B + pyproject.toml)</strong></summary>

```shell
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
uv sync
```

</details>

## CheatSheet: Commands to Run Python Scripts

Remember to activate your .venv (and install packages if they haven't been installed yet) before running files.
Verify that all external packages imported into a file are included in requirements.txt (and have NOT been commented out).

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows PowerShell</strong></summary>


```shell
py demo_script.py
py do_stats.py
py draw_chart.py
py greet_user.py
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mac/Linux/WSL</strong></summary>

```shell
python3 demo_script.py
python3 do_stats.py
python3 draw_chart.py
python3 greet_user.py
```

</details>

## CheatSheet: Commands to Git add-commit-push

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "custom message"
git push -u origin main
```

## OPTIONAL: Listen to the Audio Guides

If you prefer listening **while following the written steps above**, optional [**Audio Guides**](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-01-audio-guides/) are available. These are **AI-generated two-person podcasts**.

The audio is **supplementary** and **not a replacement for the written instructions**.
The guides are not necessarily recommended. They may be distracting, and the speakers mispronounce key files and commands.
They are mostly interesting from a state-of-the-art perspective.

## OPTIONAL: Share Feedback

Feel free to ask questions in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/discussions) or raise a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/issues) if you have suggestions or need additional clarification.
