## Taking Screenshots

## Screenshots on Mac

On a Mac, use hot keys (several options):

- Copy the Entire Screen to the Clipboard: Press Command (⌘) + Control (⌃) + Shift + 3. This captures the entire screen and copies it to the clipboard.
- Copy a Selected Portion of the Screen to the Clipboard: Press Command (⌘) + Control (⌃) + Shift + 4. This allows you to select a portion of the screen to capture, and it will be copied to the clipboard.
- Copy a Specific Window to the Clipboard: Press Command (⌘) + Control (⌃) + Shift + 4, then press the space bar. Move the camera icon over the window you want to capture, click, and the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard.
- All options: Press Command (⌘) + Shift + 5 to open the screenshot toolbar, which gives you several options.
 
## Screenshots on Windows

On Windows, use Snipping Tool or other similar app to select a rectangle, copy to clipboard, and paste into your submission.
